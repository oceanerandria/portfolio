            I studied at Humber College as a Multimedia Design and Dev. student. 
            At Humber, I touched on a lot of different domains of media such as video,
            graphic, audio, motion and even augmented reality. However, my preferred field of media 
            is Graphic Design. In 2023, I started to make use of that passion for design 
            outside of my usual academic environment. I am currently volunteering as a Designer 
            at C3 Toronto Church.
